# Members update

The list of members of the department is stored in the repository file 
[docs/_data/members.yml](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io/blob/main/docs/_data/members.yml/){:target="_blank"}
in the 
[YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML/){:target="_blank"} 
format.

```

4Ô∏è‚É£  Edit the fields appropriately.  See below for field descriptions.

‚ö†Ô∏è  At least the [required fields](#--required-fields) `name`, `dblp`, `role`, and `groups` should be set.

üî¥ Make sure the `dblp` [field](#dblp--string) is set correctly.  Otherwise, the list of publications will not contain publications of this member. ‚ùó 

5Ô∏è‚É£  Describe _Commit changes_ and  start a pull request.  Once the pull request is merged, the web page will become updated in a couple of minutes.


## ‚û°Ô∏è  Required fields

The required fields should be set for every record.

* * * 

### `name` :: string

Member full name as a string.

* * * 

### `dblp` :: string


The [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) persistent ID of the member.

‚ö†Ô∏è  This is essential for the list of publications to be automatically generated.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  To obtain the DBLP persistent ID, click
[here](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/search/author){:target="_blank"} and search for
the member on DBLP.
On the author page, look at the url and extract the part starting with `pid` and ending before `.html`.
Usually, it looks like `pid/39/11138` but it can look like `pid/24/5175-1` or `pid/v/RobertVeroff`.

* * * 

### `role` :: enum

Select the member position inside the department from the following values.

|---
| value | description
|-|-|-
| `pi` | principal investigators
| `staff` | general researchers
| `student` | PhD students
| `admin` | administrative
| `alumni` | ex-members

‚ÑπÔ∏è  The roles are used to display members under different headings in the members page.

* * * 

### `groups` :: [group]

A YAML list of groups the member belongs to.
At least one group should be specified.
Allowed list items are:

+ `main` 
+ `AR` 
+ `FAI`
+ `FM`
+ `ML`

‚ÑπÔ∏è  The members with the `main` group and with the role `pi` or `admin`, are listed
on the department [institution](/institution.html) page (as *main* members).


## ‚û°Ô∏è  Informal fields

Informal fields provide basic member information to be displayed on the members page.

* * * 

### `image` :: url

A photo of the member, preferably in a 4:3 format (vertical).
The url can be
+ an external link, like `https://my.page/image.png`, or 
+ a local link like `/images/members/user.png`.

The local links are relative to the directory
[/docs](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io/tree/main/docs){:target="_blank"} 
in the repo.
Photos can be uploaded into folder
[/docs/images/members](https://github.com/ai4reason/ai4reason.github.io/tree/main/docs/images/members){:target="_blank"}.


‚ÑπÔ∏è  Generic photo `/images/members/user.png` should be used if no photo is available.

* * * 

### `position` :: string

Informal position description as a string, like _Junior Researcher_.

* * *

### `active.from`, `active.to` :: int

Define years where the member was active (employed) in the group.
Only publications in this time span (inclusive) are displayed in the list of publications and on the _Activities_ page.
This is useful to deal with _alumni_ members.
One of the values (or both) can be unspecified in the record.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  Only years are supported (no months or days) since only the publication year is known for each publication from _dblp_.

* * *

### `interests` :: [string]

YAML list of strings with the research interests of this member.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Keep the interest strings relatively short otherwise the page layout may break.


* * * 

## ‚û°Ô∏è  Link fields

Link fields are rendered as linked images next to the member photo.
Additional link fields can be implemented on demand.

* * *

### `email` :: string

Member email as a string.

* * *

### `phone` :: string

The phone number of this member in the format `+123-55555-4444`.

* * * 

### `homepage` :: url

The URL of the homepage of this member.

* * * 

### `scholar` :: string

The Google Scholar identificator of this member.

‚ÑπÔ∏è  To obtain the Google Scholar identificator, search for the member
at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) and locate his profile.
Then extract the value of the `user` parameter (the text between `user=` and `&` or the end of the line). 
Typically, it looks like `4pW-Je4AAAAJ`.

* * *
### `orcid` :: string

The [ORCID](https://orcid.org) ID of the member as a string.

* * * 

### `github` :: string

The [GitHub](https://github.com/) username of this member.
The link `https://github.com/${github}` with `${github}` substituted by the key value
should point to the Github's user page.

* * *
